This is a template for a pysit_extensions namespace(*) package.

PySIT extensions are packages that depend on PySIT but are either not released 
publically or are released under a more restrictive license.

The intention is that all PySIT extensions will be accessible in the following 
manner:

>>> import pysit_extension.example

To create a PySIT extension package:

1) Fork or copy this template package.
2) Modify the root setup.py according to the comments.
3) Do not change pysit_extensions/__init__.py.  Do not change the name of the 
pysit_extensions directory.
4) Write your new package/module in the pysit_extensions directory exactly how 
you would any other package.

(*) A namespace package allows all packages that use this template to be 
available under the same namespace.
